        <p>This is a traditional dish in my family. 
            Anyone can make it really. It is composed of 
            traditional Mexican ingredients layered over the 
            top of one another in a lasagna-like fashion (hence the name) but 
            has little similarity to lasagna, so lasagna haters have no fear!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Step</h3>
            <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step</h3>
            <p>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in ground beef.
                Cook and stir until beef is crumbly, evenly browned,
                and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Drain and discard
                any excess grease. Add water and taco seasoning; cook and
                stir until mixture has thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
